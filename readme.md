# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio page as a Full Stack Web Developer, focused on the Javascript ecosystem including: React, Node, & PostgreSQL.

----------------------------------------------------------
## Scope / About

I have studied under Zero to Mastery: The Complete Web Developer in 2020 on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery). <br>
I am currently on the Junior to Senior course, and continuouing to work on improving my JS capabilities.

As of May 2020, I am actively on the Job hunt in Cape Town, South Africa.

This page is pure HTML, CSS, & JS. No bootstrap, no templates.
I love dark-theme, and the inspiration for this page came from [State of JS](https://stateofjs.com).

----------------------------------------------------------
## Project Status

The initial form is complete.
I will continue to add the list projects and also work to improve on the code.

----------------------------------------------------------
## Tech Used

	- HTML 
	- CSS 
	- JS 
	- NPM 
	- GitBash

----------------------------------------------------------
## Future Plans

### First Wave

	1. Add icons to index.html for the new JS projects

### Second Wave

This page will form the basis for the new webstorm.app that will be made with React as a PWA
In the meantime here is what can still be improved:

	1. Do another open source
	2. Add to Complete tech Stack
	3. Code reviews on my JS code
	4. Add more to JS page
	5. Add Bonus page - fun stuff/more about me
	6. Turn all headings into accordians (maybe)
	7. Icon Hover shows the name
	8. Menu bar hides until hover or screen touch like on video players
	9. Animate things (eg menu icon) to make it more interesting
	10. Add pdf download to footer
	11. Add resources links to footer
